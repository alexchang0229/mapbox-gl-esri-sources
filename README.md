# mapbox-gl-esri-sources
A small library to make it easier to use various Esri Map Services on a mapbox-gl map.

**Note** This library is compatible with both mapbox-gl and maplibre-gl.

## Installation & Use
`npm install mapbox-gl-esri-sources`

## Usage
Check out the [docs](https://frontiersi.github.io/mapbox-gl-esri-sources/)


## Acknowledgements
- Esri-Leaflet was one of the first open-source projects I used and contributed to. It's still a fantastic piece of work that I refered to for inspiration (and stealing some words for documentation).
- Mapbox-gl is an incredible front-end mapping library.
